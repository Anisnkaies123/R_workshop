#Using the same supermarket data from homework 1 please do the following:
#1 - Install and load the tidyverse package
#2 - What is the most profitable way of payment for the supermarket?
#3 - What is the most popular way of payment among females?
#4 - Which product lines have the poorest rating (on average)?
#5 - For each of the branches calculate and print in a single table:
  # A- the average sale per customer for each branch.
  # B- The total units sold per branch. 
  # C- The number of customers per branch
#6- In a seperate table calculate the total sales per month per branch
#7- Which branch had the highest level of sales coming from females during March? 
#8- Assume a tax rate of 7%, create the new corresponding columns to reflect this change. 
#9- Assume that branch A had a mistake in ratings, to fix this you have to reduce all the ratings for that branch by 10%,
#   create a new column to reflect this change and round the result to the nearst tenth decimal (hint: explore the round() function)
#10- Your manager only wants to see the results and the analysis for those who paid with Cash, how would you omit the others?
